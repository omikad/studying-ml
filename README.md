# Omikad's Machine Learning Study Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I delve into the fascinating world of Machine Learning! This space is dedicated to my journey of learning and exploring various Machine Learning algorithms, techniques, and concepts. Whether you're a fellow learner, a curious onlooker, or a seasoned expert, I hope you find something of value here.

## Repository Structure

This repository is not well organized, however here is a quick overview:

* AlphaGo Zero implementation, plays Connect Four game: [AlphaGo Zero implementation](https://github.com/omikad/studying-ml/tree/master/AlphaZero/alphagozero_connectfour.ipynb)

* Reinforcement Learning (RL): Inspired by Richard S. Sutton's seminal book, this section covers my implementations and experiments with RL algorithms. [Jump to RL Section](https://github.com/omikad/studying-ml/tree/master/SuttonBook)

* Art Style Transfer: an old algorithm from 2016, the first hint of what machine can do with the Art [Jump to Art Style Transfer](https://github.com/omikad/studying-ml/tree/master/Art%20Style%20Transfer)

## Useful links

Throughout this journey, I've come across many valuable resources that have helped me in my learning. Here's a list of some recommended books, courses, and articles:

* "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto [Link](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)

* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

* [OMSCS Gatech](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/computer-science)
